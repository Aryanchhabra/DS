Observations:
The median age of female passengers who survived appears to be slightly lower than that of male passengers who survived.
The range of ages for male passengers who survived is wider compared to female passengers who survived.
There are outliers in the age distribution of both genders, especially among those who did not survive.
Generally, younger passengers seem to have a higher chance of survival, regardless of gender, as indicated by the lower quartile of the box plots for survivors being generally lower than for non-survivors.
The median age of male passengers who did not survive is slightly higher than that of female passengers who did not survive.
